# A small project of building neural network model
## In this project we use keras fashion dataset to build a model of classification 

This is fashion images with their labels

Build a neural network with 4 layers (only use 10 epochs because this is a small project

With this model, we have 88-90% accuracy which is not that high but still be an example of building neural network

And this is the final result of this example
With the correct predictions, they have green color of label and the wrong predictions have red label

Example of prediction, this example has predicted 4 of 10 types, these are 2,3,4,6 but the 4th prediction has the highest ratio so final prediction is 4th and the following label is coat
